Social Connection: Social media allows teenagers to maintain friendships and connect with others, fostering a sense of belonging and social support.\n   b. Creativity: Platforms like TikTok encourage self-expression and creativity, providing a space for teens to showcase their talents.\n   c. Information Access: Social media can be a valuable source of information, promoting learning and awareness about various topics.\n\n2. Negative Effects:\n   a. Mental Health: Studies have linked excessive social media use to increased anxiety, depression, and low self-esteem, as teens often compare themselves to curated online personas.\n   b. Cyberbullying: Online harassment can lead to emotional distress, impacting mental health and social relationships.\n   c. Sleep Disturbances: The blue light from screens and the addictive nature of social media can disrupt sleep patterns, affecting overall well-being.\n   d.

Spread it on a baking sheet and bake until golden brown.

If the user wants to filter based on a comparison condition, such as checking if a key's value is greater than a specific number, the original function can be modified to accept a comparison operator as an additional parameter.

This approach can indeed handle a mix of hashable and unhashable elements, but it's crucial to consider the limitations when dealing with complex data structures.\n\nWhen faced with deeply nested unhashable elements, such as a list of dictionaries containing other lists or dictionaries, the JSON serialization method can still technically work. However, it might become less efficient and could lead to potential issues:\n\n1. **Performance**: Serializing and deserializing complex data structures can be computationally expensive, especially for large inputs or deeply nested structures.\n2. **Data loss**: JSON serialization might not preserve certain data types or structures, like sets or custom objects, leading to loss of information.\n3. **Equality comparison**: JSON strings might not accurately represent the equality of nested structures, as the order of keys in a dictionary can affect the serialized output.\n\nTo address these concerns, one could consider alternative serialization methods like `pickle` for Python objects, which is more flexible but less human-readable. Alternatively, a custom approach could be developed to handle specific data structures, possibly by creating a unique identifier for each unique nested structure.\n\n```python\nimport pickle\n\ndef unique_id(obj):\n    # Implement a custom function to generate unique identifiers for complex objects\n    pass\n\ndef unique_permutations(nums):\n    result = []\n\n    def backtrack(index, current, seen):\n        if index == len(nums):\n            result.append(current.copy())\n            return\n\n        seen_ids = set()\n        for i in range(len(nums)):\n            if isinstance(nums[i], (int, str)):\n                if nums[i] not in seen:\n                    seen.add(nums[i])\n                    current.append(nums[i])\n                    backtrack(index + 1, current, seen)\n                    current.pop()\n            else:\n                obj_id = pickle.dumps(nums[i]) if isinstance(nums[i], (list, dict)) else unique_id(nums[i])\n                if obj_id not in seen_ids:\n                    seen_ids.add(obj_id)\n                    current.append(nums[i])\n                    backtrack(index + 1, current, seen_ids)\n                    current.pop()\n\n    backtrack(0, [], set())\n    return result\n\n# Example usage\nnums = [1, [2, [3]], [2, [3]], 4]\npermutations = unique_permutations(nums)\nprint(permutations)\n```\n\nThis example demonstrates a possible direction for handling deeply nested unhashable elements, but it's essential to tailor the solution to the specific requirements and constraints of the problem at hand.\n```"}]]]}

It holds that the morality of an action is determined by its consequences. The fundamental principle is to maximize overall happiness or well-being (known as \"the greatest good for the greatest number\"). In practical terms, this means that an action is right if it leads to the greatest overall happiness for all affected, and wrong if it results in less happiness.\n\nDeontological ethics, on the other hand, is a non-consequentialist theory. It emphasizes the inherent rightness or wrongness of actions, regardless of their outcomes. Developed by philosophers like Immanuel Kant, this approach asserts that moral duties and rights are absolute and should be followed universally. Key to deontology is the concept of the \"categorical imperative,\" which dictates that one should only act in ways that could be made into a universal law.\n\nIn modern ethical dilemmas, these differences have significant implications. For instance, consider a life-saving medical treatment that can only be given to one patient, but not to others. Utilitarianism might argue for treating the patient with the highest chance of survival, maximizing overall well-being. Deontology, however, might argue that all patients have an equal right to life and that it's wrong to prioritize one over the others without a justifiable reason.\n\nIn summary, utilitarianism focuses on outcomes, while deontology emphasizes duty and universal principles.

The Great Depression of 1929 was exacerbated by these economic imbalances, causing widespread unemployment and hardship.\n\n2. **Weakened Empires**: The treaty dismantled the Austro-Hungarian and Ottoman Empires, creating new nation-states with unresolved ethnic tensions. This led to conflicts and instability in regions like the Balkans, which were prone to nationalist movements.\n\n3. **Nationalism and Extremism**: The perceived injustice of the Treaty fueled nationalism not only in Germany but also in other countries. For instance, Italy, under Benito Mussolini, felt it had not received its fair share of territorial gains, leading to the rise of Fascism.\n\n4. **Imperial Rivalries**: The redrawing of borders and the weakening of traditional European powers created opportunities for new powers, like the Soviet Union and Japan, to expand their influence. This led to increased competition and tensions, particularly in Asia.\n\n5. **Disillusionment with Democracy**: The harsh terms of the Treaty contributed to a loss of faith in democratic systems, as people sought strong, authoritarian leaders who promised to restore national pride and stability.\n\nIn summary, the Treaty of Versailles disrupted the global economic order, fueled nationalism, and created conditions that allowed extremist ideologies to gain traction in various countries, not just Germany.
