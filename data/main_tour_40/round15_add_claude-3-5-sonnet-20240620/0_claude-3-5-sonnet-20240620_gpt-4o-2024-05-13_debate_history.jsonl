A 2020 study published in the Journal of Adolescence found that teens who spend more than three hours per day on social media are at a higher risk of mental health problems.\n2. **Self-Esteem and Body Image**: Exposure to idealized images and lifestyles can lead to negative self-comparisons.

U1 snRNA recognizes the 5' splice site\n2. U2 snRNA binds to the branch point sequence\n3. U4/U6/U5 tri-snRNP joins the complex\n4.

Facilitating RNA-RNA interactions\n3. Catalyzing the splicing reactions\n\nThis intricate interplay between snRNAs and proteins ensures accuracy by precisely identifying splice sites and efficiency through the stepwise assembly and catalysis of the splicing reaction.

One approach has been the gradual adaptation of inherited political systems to better align with local contexts. For example, South Africa's transition from apartheid to a democratic system involved significant constitutional reforms that incorporated both Western democratic principles and local traditions of consensus-building.\n\nAnother strategy has been the decentralization of power to address the centralization issues inherited from colonial rule. Uganda, for instance, has implemented a system of local governance that empowers regional authorities, helping to mitigate ethnic tensions and improve local administration.\n\nInternational organizations and foreign powers have played complex roles in these efforts. On one hand, organizations like the United Nations and the African Union have provided crucial support through peacekeeping missions, development aid, and capacity-building programs. For example, the UN's involvement in Sierra Leone's post-civil war reconstruction helped stabilize the country and reform its political institutions.\n\nOn the other hand, foreign powers sometimes hinder progress by prioritizing their strategic interests over genuine development. For instance, the involvement of foreign powers in the Democratic Republic of Congo has often been driven by the desire to control its vast mineral resources, which has exacerbated corruption and conflict rather than fostering stable governance.\n\nIn summary, African countries have balanced reforming colonial-era institutions with governance and development challenges through constitutional reforms, decentralization, and leveraging international support. However, the role of foreign powers remains a double-edged sword, offering both opportunities and obstacles.\n\n</respond>\n\n<criticize>\nMy opponent's response lacks specific examples of how African countries have balanced these reforms with governance and development challenges.
