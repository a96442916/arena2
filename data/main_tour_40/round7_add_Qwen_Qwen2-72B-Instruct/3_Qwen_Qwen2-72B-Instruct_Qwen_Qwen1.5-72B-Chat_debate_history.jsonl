Initially, his involvement was limited to delivering coded messages and providing a safe haven for revolutionaries. However, the rise of the Committee of Public Safety and the Reign of Terror forced Jacques to confront the harsh realities of the revolution.\n\nThe Committee of Public Safety, established in 1793, was tasked with protecting the Revolution from its enemies. Its methods, however, were often brutal and indiscriminate. Jacques witnessed the arrest and execution of his friends and neighbors, accused of being counter-revolutionaries without evidence. This brutality radicalized him, pushing him to take up arms and fight against the oppressive forces within the revolution itself.\n\nDuring the Reign of Terror, Jacques joined the ranks of the sans-culottes, the radical urban workers who were the backbone of the revolution. He participated in the defense of the revolutionary government against internal and external threats. However, he also saw the excesses of the revolution, the fear and paranoia that gripped Paris, and the loss of innocent lives. These experiences made him question the true nature of the revolution and the price of freedom.\n\nJacques' beliefs were shaped by these events. He became disillusioned with the revolutionary leaders who had become as oppressive as the monarchy they had overthrown. He realized that the revolution was not just about toppling a regime but about creating a just and equitable society.

Bake in a preheated oven at 190°C (375°F) for about 12-15 minutes, or until the soufflé has risen and is golden brown.\n\n4. **Red Wine Reduction**: While the soufflé bakes, reduce a high-quality red wine, such as a Pinot Noir, with a touch of sugar and a sprig of thyme until it thickens and intensifies in flavor.\n\n5. **Assembly**: Once the soufflé is ready, remove it from the oven and carefully transfer it to a serving plate. Drizzle the red wine reduction around the soufflé, creating an artistic contrast. Garnish with micro-greens, a few shaved truffle slices, and a light dusting of truffle salt.\n\nThis dish exemplifies modern French cuisine by combining the luxurious flavors of foie gras and truffles with the delicate nature of a soufflé, while the red wine reduction adds a touch of contemporary sophistication.

This can lead to higher memory usage as the ArrayList may allocate more space than immediately needed, especially if the number of elements fluctuates widely. However, this extra space can also reduce the frequency of resizing operations.\n- **Garbage Collection Overhead**: The resizing operation in an ArrayList involves creating a new array and copying the elements from the old array to the new one. This can generate temporary objects that need to be garbage collected, especially if the resizing occurs frequently. However, since resizing is an infrequent operation, the garbage collection overhead is generally low.\n\n**Fixed-Size Array with Manual Resizing:**\n- **Memory Usage**: Using a fixed-size array requires you to manage the resizing manually.

The use of English and Afrikaans as official languages during apartheid excluded many black South Africans from political participation and access to power.

Utilitarianism, championed by philosophers like Jeremy Bentham and John Stuart Mill, is a form of consequentialism that focuses on the outcomes of actions. It suggests that the rightness or wrongness of an action is determined by its consequences, aiming for the greatest good for the greatest number of people.
